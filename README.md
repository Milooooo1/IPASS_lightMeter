This is a project for a class at the Hogeschool Utrecht, Technische-Informatica. 

This project includes a libary for the BH1750 lightintensity sensor and an test application showing that the libary works. 
This project also contains a lightmeter application which uses the [hwlib](https://github.com/wovo/hwlib "Hwlib by wovo") and my BH1750 library. It also includes a library for a camera lightmeter application. This library uses the BH1750 library and calculates the ISO, Aperature and Shutterspeed for a correctly exposed image. 
If you wish to build the full lightmeter application follow this schematic made with [Frizting](https://fritzing.org/download/ "Fritzing")
If the schematic is build correctly you can run the `test_app.cpp` as an example.
